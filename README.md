# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repo contains the assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project (Coursera)

You can find in this repo:
- README.md with information about this repo

- run_analysis.R is a script that does the following:
   * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and     each subject.

- CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

The data for the project can be downloaded from here:
